GET /regenradar/nederland HTTP/1.1

1.2)No the content is the raw html which does not get rendered as telnet is not a browser

1.3)X-cache is a field which is supposed to supply information wether the requested resource was found or not in a nearby cache

1.4) the Cache=Control directive indicates the maximum amount of seconds a resource is allowed to stay ina  cache (because otherwise it would be too out-of-date)

2.1)if the content-length field is smaller the message gets cut off. If it is larger it gets filled up with /r/n/r/n until you reach the total number space indicated.

3.1) nothing too weird, it seems to maintain its information, might be because of browser caching.

3.2) At first I obviously get a 401 response as I have not provided any authorization. When using Authorization: Basic [base-64 encoded username/password string] I don't get a 401. I get a 200 status code.
